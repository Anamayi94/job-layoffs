# Job Layoff Analysis Project
* Overview
This project focuses on analyzing job layoff data using SQL, specifically MySQL. The main goal was to clean the dataset, handle duplicates, manage missing data, and conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights into layoff trends across industries, company sizes, and time periods. The insights derived can be useful for understanding broader economic patterns and preparing for future workforce shifts.

* Project Objective
The primary objective of this project is to:

1. Clean and prepare a layoff dataset for analysis.
2. Identify and remove duplicate entries.
3. Explore trends and patterns in layoffs, focusing on factors such as industry, company size, percentage of workforce laid off, and layoff timing.
4. Provide insights that can help understand how economic or market shifts affect employment.


* Data Source
The data used in this project was obtained from a public dataset. The dataset includes information on layoffs across various companies, industries, and time periods e.t.c

* Process Outline
The analysis was conducted in two main phases:

Data Cleaning: To ensure data consistency and accuracy by handling missing data and duplicate records.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): To gain insights into layoff patterns and trends across companies and industries.


* Future Work
Potential next steps to build on this project include:

Visualization: Adding data visualization (using PowerBI, or Python's Matplotlib/Seaborn) to create dashboards for interactive exploration.
Predictive Modeling: Using historical data to forecast future layoff trends.
Industry Comparison: Conducting a more detailed industry-specific analysis to see which industries are more susceptible to layoffs under different economic conditions.
